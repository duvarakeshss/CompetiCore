Overview
The Tournament Management System is a C++ application designed to efficiently manage various aspects of organizing and running tournaments. The system is implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for better code organization, modularity, and reusability.

Features
Player Management: Allows adding, removing, and updating player information.
Tournament Creation: Enables the creation of new tournaments, specifying rules, categories, and participants.
Match Scheduling: Facilitates scheduling matches within tournaments, taking into account player availability and preferences.

Object-Oriented Design
The project follows an Object-Oriented Design approach with the following key classes:

Player: Represents a player participating in tournaments. Contains information such as name, age, rank, etc.
Tournament: Represents a tournament, including its rules, categories, participants, and matches.
Match: Represents a single match between two players or teams within a tournament.

Requirements
C++ compiler (C++11 or later)
Standard Template Library (STL) support
Object-Oriented Programming concepts understanding
Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/tournament-management.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd tournament-management
Compile the source code: g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o tournament_management
Run the executable: ./tournament_management

Usage
Upon running the executable, the user will be presented with a menu providing various options for managing tournaments and players.
Follow the on-screen instructions to perform desired operations such as creating a tournament, adding players, scheduling matches, etc.

Implementation Details
Object-Oriented Programming: The project utilizes classes and objects to encapsulate data and functionality, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
File Handling: Player and tournament data may be stored and retrieved from disk for persistence.
Algorithmic Design: Efficient algorithms are employed for tasks such as match scheduling and score tracking to ensure optimal performance.
